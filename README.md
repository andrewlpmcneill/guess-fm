Guess FM is a game where users are played a random radio station and have to guess what country it is from.

## Motivation

Inspired by the trend of simple online games like Wordle, Guess FM combines the functionality of GeoGuessr - a game where users guess where in the world a Google Street View image is - with the API of Radio Garden â€” an app that aggregates radio stations from all over the world.
